Hello my name is Angel.

This application simulates a store, where the user can add items to the shopping cart, remove them, check what's
inside and purchase them.

The instructions to develop the application were a bit ambiguous, so I am going to explain how I interpreted them and what
I decided to do.

Firstly, it said that "The application should allow users to add products to their cart" and also there must be a Product class,
with some attributes. But I didn't know if the intention was to allow the user to add whatever product they wanted to their cart,
as if the user created the item, typing the name, description, etc... as they navigated through the store, or that I should create
a few default products and those are the ones the user has access to. So I decided to implement both systems, after introducing
the command "add" the user has to choose between selecting a pre-created item, or creating a new one. In case they choose
creating the item, it will be also added to the store.

Taking into account the "user authentication" mentioned in the instructions, I developed a login method, and a few default users to test
its functionality, but as previously stated, it wasn't clear if it was expected to have a default user to test, so I also implemented a method to
create new users on the run. At the initialization of the program, 3 users are created.

username: Ana password: 1234
username: Juan password: 5555
username: Paco password: 6666

Ana has two coupons to use and Juan and Paco only one.

In order To give the program more flexibility, I decided to implement a function to change the current "user session", Which allow the user
to maintain its shopping cart data, even after logging out.
